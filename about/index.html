                <p>People often forget, are unaware, or fail to comprehend that Asian people can also be born and live in Spanish-speaking
                     countries. In Peru, for example, there is a long history of Chinese immigration and a strong Asian community. My mom's side 
                    of the family is Chinese Peruvian, and with this index I hope to gather the scattered evidence across the internet of this 
                    often overlooked aspect of Peruvian culture and history.</p>

                <p>Growing up, I never realized how intertwined the history of Chinese (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asian_Peruvians" target="_blank">and other Asian</a>) immigrants is with that of Peru's. 
                    Outside of my family, I never saw any representation of Spanish-speaking or Hispanic Asians. Learning more about the long 
                    established history of the Asian Peruvian community has helped legitimize my family's experiences and my own identity. 
                    Through this collection of links and images, perhaps this centralized bank of knowledge can help others in the same way.</p>
