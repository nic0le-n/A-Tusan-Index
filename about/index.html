            <p>People either (a) forget, (b) are unaware of, or (c) can't comprehend that Asian people can also be born and/or live in Spanish speaking
                countries. In Peru, specifically, there is a long history of Chinese immigration and a strong Asian community. My mom's side is Chinese 
                Peruvian, and with this index I hope to compile some of the sparse evidence across the internet of this overlooked aspect of Peruvian 
                culture/history.</p>

            <p>Growing up, I never realized how inextricable the history of Chinese (and other Asian) immigrants is from that of Peru's. 
                Outside of my family, I never saw any representation of spanish-speaking or Hispanic Asians. Learning more about the long 
                established history of the Asian Peruvian community has helped legitimize my family's experiences and my own identity. 
                Through this collection of links and images, perhaps this centralized bank of knowledge can help others in the same way.</p>
